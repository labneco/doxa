== Introduction

The models API allows modules to interact with Doxa's models and records. This
API is mainly an ORM but with additional features needed for business logic.
Developers familiar with Odoo's ORM should find many similarities with the
latter.

Special care has been put in Doxa's model API to ease development. In
particular:

* Almost no reflection so that a standard Go IDE can propose relevant
inspections and autocompletion.
* Type safety by preferring structs to maps and almost never use string
references so that most mistakes can be spotted at compile time.

== RecordSets

=== Records and RecordSets types

Each model has a definition instance that can be retrieved by using the
`__Model__()` function of the `h` package. This model instance will be used
to extend/modify the model definition.

Interaction with models and records is performed through RecordSets, a sorted
set of Records of the same model. Methods defined on a model are executed on a
RecordSet.

Each model has its own RecordSet Go type named by appending "Set" to the
model's name (e.g. the RecordSet type for the `Partner` model is called
`PartnerSet`). All RecordSet types implement the `RecordSet` interface, but
also a whole set of methods with defined names but which differ by the
parameters or return values types. For example, all RecordSets implement a
`Create` method but each take a Record struct of its model type and return its
own type.

Each model has also its own Record Go type which is named by appending "Data"
to its model's name (e.g. `PartnerData`). A Record type is simply a struct
with all the fields of the model whether they are stored into the database or
computed on the fly. Record types are used to read and write values to
RecordSets.

All Record and RecordSet types live in the `h` package.

=== Using RecordSets

RecordSets are self-querying. One should initialize an empty RecordSet call
`search()` on it to populate it from the database. RecordSets implement lazy
loading, so that data is actually queried only when needed.

An empty RecordSet instance of a model `ModelName` can be instantiated by
calling the `NewSet(env Environment)` of its model instance.

=== Common RecordSet Methods

The following methods can be called RecordSet instances.

[NOTE]
====
A parameter or return value of type `RecordSetType` means the actual type of
the RecordSet for this model (not an interface).

A parameter or return value of type `RecordType` means the actual type of the
Record struct for this model (e.g. `PartnerData`).
====

==== Data Access Methods

`*First() RecordType*`::
Returns a copy of the first Record of the RecordSet. It returns an empty
RecordType if the RecordSet is empty.

`*All() []RecordType*`::
Returns all Records of the RecordSet as a slice of RecordType. It returns an
empty slice if the RecordSet is empty.

`*Read(fields []string) []FieldMap*`::
Returns all Records of the RecordSet as a slice of FieldMap. It returns an
empty slice if the RecordSet is empty.

RecordSets implement type safe getters and setters for all fields of the
Record struct type.

`*__FieldName__() __FieldType__*`::
Getter for the field called `__FieldName__` of type `__FieldType__` of the
`First()` Record of the RecordSet. Call to the getter will make a call to
`Read()` first if the field is not loaded in the RecordSet's cache.
+
It returns the Go zero value of the type if it is called on an empty RecordSet.

`*Set__FieldName__(value __FieldType__)*`::
Setter for the field called `__FieldName__` of type `__FieldType__`. If the
RecordSet has several Records, all of them will be updated. Each call to the
setter makes an update query in the database.
+
It panics if it is called on an empty RecordSet.

NOTE: The `__FieldType__` of a relation field (i.e. many2one, ...) is a
RecordSet of the type of the related model.

==== CRUD Methods

`*(Model) Create(env Environment, data *RecordType) RecordSetType*`::
Insert a new record in the database with the given data and returns the
inserted Record. Fields which are not given a value are set to the type's zero
value.

[source,go]
----
customer := h.Partner().Create(env, q.PartnerData{
    Name: "Jane Smith",
    Email: "jsmith@example.com",
    Position: "Sale's Manager",
})
fmt.Println(customer.Name())
// Returns:
// Jane Smith
----

You can also use the `Create` alias on a RecordSet instance. In this case,
the actual values of the RecordSet are silently ignored.

[source,go]
----
customer := h.Partner().NewSet(env).Create(h.PartnerData{
    Name: "Jane Smith",
    Email: "jsmith@example.com",
    Position: "Sale's Manager",
})
fmt.Println(customer.Name())
// Returns:
// Jane Smith

----

`*Write(data *RecordType, fieldsToUnset ...models.FieldName) bool*`::
Update records in the database with the given data. Updates are made with a
single SQL query. Fields in `fieldsToUnset` are first set to their Go zero
value, then all non-zero values of data are updated.

[source,go]
----
partner := h.Partner().Search(env, q.Partner().Where().Company().Name().Equals("NDP Syst√®mes"))
partner.Write(h.Partner{
    Lang: "fr_FR",
})
----

IMPORTANT: As said above, zero values in the `data` struct fields will *NOT* be
updated. If you are not sure whether the values you pass in the `data` struct
are zero values or not (e.g. when setting from a variable), include their
`FieldName` in the `fieldsToUnset` to be sure the value will be correctly
updated in case it is a zero value.

`*Unlink() bool*`::
Deletes the database records that are linked with this RecordSet.

`*Load(fields ...models.FieldName) RecordSetType*`::
Populates this RecordSet with the data from the database matching the current
search condition. If fields are given, only those fields are fetched and the
other fields of the Records are set to their `go` zero value.
+
Calling Load on an empty RecordSet with an empty query will have no effect.
To load a whole table, use `FetchAll()`.

NOTE: Call to `Load()` is optional. It will be automatically called (without
fields arguments) on the first call to a getter or when calling `Records()`.

TIP: Calling `Load()` with fields arguments before any other call allows to
finely control which fields will be queried from the database since subsequent
calls to a getter will not call `Read()` again if the value is already loaded.

[source,go]
----
partners := h.Partner().NewSet(env)
partners.Search(q.Partner().Where().Name().ILike("John")).Read(h.Partner().Name, h.Partner().Birthday)

// The following lines will not load from the database, but use
// the values cached in the RecordSet.
for _, p := range partners.Records() {
    fmt.Println(p.Name(), p.Birthday())
}
// Returns:
// John Smith 1982-06-03
// John Doo 1975-01-06
----

`*FetchAll() RecordSetType*`::
Returns a RecordSet with all items of the table, regardless of the current
RecordSet query. It is mainly meant to be used on an empty RecordSet.

==== Search Methods

`*(Model) Search(env Environment, condition ConditionType) RecordSetType*`::
Search the database for matching records and return them as RecordSet.
A new Condition instance can be created from a model instance.

[source,go]
----
cond := q.Users().Email().ILike("example.com").Or().Email().ILike("example.net")
users := h.Users().Search(env, cond)
----

`*(RecordSet) Search(condition ConditionType) RecordSetType*`::
Apply the given search condition to the given RecordSet. This will narrow the
RecordSet current filter.

====
.Available methods on Condition type
* `And()`
* `AndNot()`
* `AndCond(condition ConditionType)`
* `Or()`
* `OrNot()`
* `OrCond(condition ConditionType)`
====
====
.Available operator methods
Depending on the field type, all or part of the following operator methods
will be available:

`Equals`, `NotEquals`, `Greater`, `GreaterOrEqual`, `Lower`, `LowerOrEqual`,
`Like`, `NotLike`,`Contains`, `NotContains`, `IContains`, `NotIContains`, `In`,
`NotIn`, `ChildOf`, `IsNull`, `IsNotNull`

Each of these methods take a `value` parameter which is of the same Go type as
the field on which it is applied.

For each of them there are two derived methods suffixed respectively with
`Func` and `Eval` :

- `Func` suffixed methods (e.g. `EqualsFunc`) take as argument a function
whose first argument is a RecordSet and that returns a value with the same Go
type as the field on which it is called.
+
eg. `func(rs models.RecordSet) int64`
+
The function will be evaluated at the time of the query by passing it the
RecordSet we are querying and the result will be substituted in the query.
- `Eval` suffixed methods (e.g. `EqualsEval`) take an expression string as
argument. This expression will be passed as is to the client and evaluated
client side.
+
IMPORTANT: The returned condition of an `Eval` suffixed method cannot be
evaluated on server side. Thus `Eval` suffixed methods must NOT be used
within the `Search()` method.
====
====
.Searches on joined tables
Searches can also be performed on joined model fields with the
`__FK__FilteredOn()` methods:

[source,go]
----
cond := q.Users().PartnerFilteredOn(q.Partner().Function().ILike("manager"))
users := h.Users().Search(env, cond)
----

Conditions with `__FK__FilteredOn()` can be nested:

[source,go]
----
cond := q.Users().PartnerFilteredOn(q.Partner().CountryFilteredOn(q.Country().Code.Equals("F")))
----

They can also be mixed with simple conditions:

[source,go]
----
cond := q.Users().PartnerFilteredOn(q.Partner().Function().ILike("manager")).And().Login().ILike("John")
----
====

`*(Model) Browse(env Environment, ids []int64) RecordSetType*`::
Search the database and returns a RecordSet with the records having the given ids.

`*(RecordSet) Browse(ids []int64) RecordSetType*`::
Narrows this RecordSet by selecting only those with the given ids.
This function is only a shortcut for `Search` on a list on ids.

`*SearchCount() int*`::
Return the number of records matching the search condition.

`*SearchByName(name string, op operator.Operator, additionalCond Condition, limit int) RecordSetType*`::
Search for records that have a display name matching the given
`name` pattern when compared with the given `op` operator, while also
matching the optional `additionalCond` condition.
+
This is used for example to provide suggestions based on a partial
value for a relational field. Sometimes be seen as the inverse
function of `NameGet` but it is not guaranteed to be.

`*FetchAll() RecordSetType*`::
Returns a RecordSet with all the records in the database for the RecordSet's
model.

`*Limit(n int) RecordSetType*`::
Limit the search to `n` results.

`*Offset(n int) RecordSetType*`::
Offset the search by `n` results.

`*OrderBy(exprs ...string) RecordSetType*`::
Order the results by the given expressions. Each expression is a string with a
valid field name and optionally a direction.

[source,go]
----
users := h.Users().NewSet(env).SearchAll().OrderBy("Name ASC", "Email DESC", "ID")
----

==== RecordSet Operations

`*Ids() []int64*`::
Return a slice with all the ids of this RecordSet. Performs a lazy loading of
the RecordSet if it is not already loaded.

`*Env() *Environment*`::
Returns the RecordSet's Environment.

`*Len() int*`::
Returns the number of records in this RecordSet.

`*Record(i int) RecordSetType*`::
Returns a new RecordSet with only the i^th^ Record inside.

`*Records() []RecordSetType*`::
Returns a slice of RecordSets, each with only one Record of the current
RecordSet.

`*EnsureOne()*`::
Check that this RecordSet contains only one Record. Panics if there are more
than one Record or if there are no Records at all.

`*Filtered(fn func(RecordType) bool) RecordSetType*`::
Select the records in this RecordSet such that fn(Record) is true, and return
them as a RecordSet. Filtered will use the data in cache if present.

NOTE: Unless the RecordSet is already loaded in cache, it might be faster
and more efficient to use `Search()` on the RecordSet to return a filtered
Set.

`*Sorted(less func(RecordSet, RecordSet) bool) RecordSetType*`::
Returns a sorted copy of this RecordSet. `less(rs1, rs2)` should return true
if rs1 < rs2.
+
The Sort is not guaranteed to be stable.

`*SortedDefault() RecordSetType*`::
Returns a sorted copy of this RecordSet according to the model's default order.

`*SortedByField(f FieldNamer, reverse bool) RecordSetType*`::
Returns a sorted copy of this RecordSet by comparing the given field.
If reverse is true, the sort is done in reversed order.

`*Union(other RecordSetType) RecordSetType*`::
Returns a new RecordSet that is the union of this RecordSet and the given
`other` RecordSet. The result is guaranteed to be a set of unique records.

`*Subtract(other RecordSetType) RecordSetType*`::
Returns a RecordSet with the Records that are in this RecordSet but not in the
given 'other' one. The result is guaranteed to be a set of unique records.

`*Equals(other RecordSetType) bool*`::
Returns true if this RecordSet is equal to the other RecordSet, that is they
are from the same model and reference the same ids.

== Environment

The Environment stores various contextual data used by the ORM: the database
transaction (for database queries), the current user (for access rights
checking) and the current context (storing arbitrary metadata).

The usual way to get the current Environment is to call `Env()` on a RecordSet.

=== Environment Methods

The following methods are available on the Environment.

`*Cr() *Cursor*`::
Returns the cursor to the database. The cursor is a wrapper around the current
database transaction that can be used for <<Direct Database Access>>.

`*Uid() int64*`::
Returns the user ID of the current user.

`*Context() *types.Context()*`::
Returns the context of this Environment. The context is a
read only map for storing arbitrary metadata. See <<Context Methods>>.

=== Context Methods

The Context of an Environment is a read only map for storing arbitrary
metadata. To modify the context, you need to modify the Environment
(see <<Modifying the Environment>>).

`*HasKey(key string) bool*`::
Returns true if the Context has a value for the given key.

`*Get(key string) interface{}*`::
Returns the value of the Context for the given key. It returns nil if the
Context does not contain this key.

NOTE: If you know the expected return type, you would probably use one of the
following typed methods instead.

`*GetString(key string) string*`::
Returns the value of the given key in this Context as a string.
It panics if the value is not of type string

`*GetInteger(key string) int64*`::
Returns the value of the given key in this Context as an int64.
It panics if the value cannot be casted to int64

`*GetFloat(key string) float64*`::
Returns the value of the given key in this Context as a float64.
It panics if the value cannot be casted to float64

`*GetStringSlice(key string) []string*`::
Returns the value of the given key in this Context as a []string.
It panics if the value is not a slice or if any value is not a string

`*GetIntegerSlice(key string) []int64*`::
Returns the value of the given key in this Context as a []int64.
It panics if the value is not a slice or if any value cannot be casted to int64

`*GetFloatSlice(key string) []float64*`::
Returns the value of the given key in this Context as a []float64.
It panics if the value is not a slice or if any value cannot be casted to
float64

`*SetEntry(key string, value interface{}) *Context*`::
Returns a copy of this Context with the given key set to the given value.

A pointer to a new empty Context can be created with `types.NewContext()`

=== Executing in a new Environment

`*models.ExecuteInNewEnvironment(uid int64, fnct func(Environment)) error*`::
Executes the given `fnct` in a new Environment within a new database
transaction and commit the transaction on success. In case `fnct` panics, the
transaction is rolled back instead and the panic data is returned as error.

`*models.SimulateInNewEnvironment(uid int64, fnct func(Environment)) error*`::
Executes the given `fnct` in a new Environment within a new database
transaction but rolls back the transaction at the end. In case `fnct` panics,
the panic data is returned as error.
+
This function is mainly useful for testing when database modification must be
avoided.

=== Modifying the Environment

The Environment is immutable. It can be customized with the following methods
to be applied on the RecordSet.

`*Sudo(uid ...int64) RecordSetType*`::
Call the next method as Super User. If uid is given, use the given user id
instead.

[source,go]
----
noReplyUser := h.Users().Search(env, q.Users().Email().Equals("no-reply@ndp-systemes.fr")).Limit(1)
partners := h.Partner().Search(env, q.Partner().Name().ILike("John"))

partners.Sudo(noReplyUser.ID()).SendConfirmationEmail()
----

`*WithEnv(env Environment) RecordSetType*`::
Returns a copy of the current RecordSet with the given Environment.

`*WithContext(key string, value interface{}) RecordSetType*`::
Returns a copy of the current RecordSet with its context extended by the
given key and value.

`*WithNewContext(context types.Context) RecordSetType*`::
Returns a copy of the current RecordSet with its context replaced by the
given one.

=== Direct Database Access

Direct database access is possible through the Cursor of the Environment. The
Cursor provides the following methods for accessing the database. All methods
operate inside the current transaction.

`*Execute(query string, args ...interface{}) sql.Result*`::
Execute a query without returning any rows. It panics in case of error.
The args are for any placeholder parameters in the query. Whatever the database
backend used, the placeholder is `?`.

`*Get(dest interface{}, query string, args ...interface{})*`::
Queries a row into the database and maps the result into dest.
The query must return only one row. It panics on errors.

`*Select(dest interface{}, query string, args ...interface{})*`::
Queries multiple rows and map the result into dest which must be a slice.
Select panics on errors.

[source,go]
----
type dbStruct struct {
    Name: string
    Age:  int
}
var single dbStruct
var data []dbStruct

rc.env.Cr().Get(&single, "SELECT name, age FROM partner WHERE id = ?", 12)
rc.env.Cr().Select(&data, "SELECT name, age FROM partner WHERE age > ?", 25)
----

NOTE: Direct database access should be avoided whenever possible because it
by-passes all security restrictions. Use the RecordSet API instead.

== Creating / extending models

When developing a Doxa module, you can create your own models and/or
extend in place existing models created by other modules.

[source,go]
----
resPartnerModel := h.Partner()
resUsersModel := h.Users()
----

All models, fields and methods definitions MUST be made in the `init()` of
the main package or of a package called by the module's main package.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After creating or modifying a model, you must run `doxa generate` to
generate the types in the `h` and `q` packages before starting the Doxa server.

Running `doxa generate` will also allow you to obtain code completion and
inspections on the newly created types.
====

=== Creating a new model
`*(*Model) DeclareModel() *Model*`::

Declare a new model. This function should be called on a 'not-yet-created'
instance of the model we want to create. It is actually a placeholder, the code
generation will make the actual Model creation.

[source,go]
----
// Create a new model called 'User'
h.User().DeclareModel()
----

The created model will have a single `ID` field which is the model's primary
key. It returns an pointer to the created model instance.

`*DeclareMixinModel() *Model*`::

Declare a new mixin model. Mixin model are not meant to be accessible like a
 regular model but are meant to be mixed in other models.
+
See <<Model Mix In>>

`*DeclareTransientModel() *Model*`::

Creates a new transient model with the given name. Transient model instances
have a limited life time and are automatically removed from database. They
are mainly used for wizards.

=== Fields declaration

Models fields are added by the `AddField` method of a model as in the example below:

[source,go]
----
course := h.Course().DeclareModel()
course.AddFields(map[string]models.FieldDefinition{
    "Name":      models.CharField{String: "Name", Help: "This is the name of the course", Required: true},
    "Date":      models.DateField{String: "Date of the Course"},
    "Teacher":   models.Many2OneField{RelationModel: h.Partner(), String: "Teacher"},
    "LimitDate": models.DateTimeField{Required: true},
    "Attendees": models.Many2manyField{RelationModel: h.Partner(), String: "Attendees"},
})
----

Available fields types are:

`*BinaryField{}*`::
A binary field holds arbitrary data that is meant to be delivered to the
client as a file. Binary fields are mapped to `string` go type.
`*BooleanField{}*`::
`*CharField{}*`::
A Char field is a string field that is meant to be displayed as a single line
in the client. Char fields are mapped to go strings.
`*DateField{}*`::
Date fields are mapped to models.Date structs.
`*DateTimeField{}*`::
DateTime fields are mapped to models.Date structs.
`*FloatField{}*`::
`*HTMLField{}*`::
HTML fields are formatted with their HTML content by the client.
`*IntegerField{}*`::
`*Many2ManyField{}*`::
`*Many2OneField{}*`::
`*One2ManyField{}*`::
`*One2OneField{}*`::
`*Rev2OneField{}*`::
Rev2One fields are the reverse relation of one2one in the model that does not
have an FK.
`*SelectionField{}*`::
A selection field can have as values only a set of predefined strings.
`*TextField{}*`::
A Text field is a string field that is meant to be displayed on multiple lines
in the client. Text fields are mapped to go strings.

As in the example below:


==== Overriding fields

Fields attributes can be overridden by using one of the following methods that
apply on a Field instance.

`*(f *Field) SetString(value string) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetHelp(value string) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetGroupOperator(value string) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetRelated(value string) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetCompute(value Methoder) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetDepends(value []string) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetStored(value bool) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetRequired(value bool) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetReadOnly(value bool) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetUnique(value bool) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetIndex(value bool) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetNoCopy(value bool) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetTranslate(value bool) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetDefault(value func(Environment) interface{}) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetOnchange(value Methoder) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetConstraint(value Methoder) *Field*`::
`*(f *Field) SetInverse(value Methoder) *Field*`::

[source,go]
----
course := h.Course().Fields().Name().SetString("MyNewName").SetHelp("This is the new name of the course")
----

==== Field parameters

Field parameters are set in the params struct that is passed to the field's
creation/override method. Params structs only differ by the options available
to specific types. Below is the list and explanation for each parameter.

===== Field type parameters

`ReverseFK` string::
Set the foreign key field name in the related model for `one2many` and
`rev2one` relations.

`RelationModel` string::
Set the other model for a relation field.

`M2MLinkModelName` string::
Set the name of the intermediate model for a `many2many` relation. This
parameter is mandatory only if there are several `many2many` relations
between the two models.

`M2MOurField` string::
In a `many2many` relation, set the name of the field of the intermediate model
that points to this (our) model. This parameter is mandatory only if the
`many2many` relation is pointing to the same model.

`M2MTheirField` string::
In a `many2many` relation, set the name of the field of the intermediate model
that points to the other (their) model, i.e. the model defined by
`RelationModel`. This parameter is mandatory only if the `many2many` relation
is pointing to the same model.

`OnDelete` OnDeleteAction::
Defines what to do with this record if the target record is deleted. Possible
values are `models.SetNull` (default), `models.Restrict` and `models.Cascade`.

`Selection` map[string]string::
Map of predefined allowed values for a Selection field. The map keys are the
actual values, and the map values are the labels to display for each value.

`Size` int::
Maximum size for the `string` type in database.

`Digits` types.Digit::
Sets the decimal precision to a Go `float` type to store as a decimal type in
database. Digit objects have a `Scale` field that defines the total number of
digits and a `Precision` field that defines the number of digits after the
decimal point.

`JSON` string::
Field's JSON value that will be used for the column name in the database and
for json serialization to the client.

`Translate` bool::
Set to true if the value of this field must be translated in the user
interface. This can be the case for product names or descriptions for
instance.

`GoType` interface{}::
Specifies the go type to which the field should be mapped. `GoType` should be
set to a pointer to such a type's value.
+
If the given type is not a standard type then it must implement `driver.Valuer`
and `sql.Scanner` interfaces.

[source,go]
----
session := h.Session().DeclareModel()
session.AddFields(map[string]models.FieldDefinition{
    "Room No": models.IntegerField{GoType: new(int16)},
})
----

===== Field's metadata parameters

`String` string::
Field's label inside the application.
`Help` string::
Field's help typically displayed as tooltip.

===== Field's modifiers parameters

`Required` bool::
Defines the field as required (i.e. not null).

`ReadOnly` bool::
This field will be shown as read only on all views.
Note that this does not prevent setting the field by code or through a method.

`Unique` bool::
Defines the field as unique in the database table.

`Index` bool::
Creates an index on this field in the database.

`NoCopy` bool::
Fields marked with this tag will not be copied when a record is duplicated.

`Default` func(Environment) interface{}::
Function that will be called by clients to set a default value in the user
interface before calling Create.
+
The default value will also be set when calling Create only if this is a required field and no value is set.

`OnChange` Methoder::
The method to call when this field is changed in the interface.
The value must be a method on this RecordSet with the following
signature, which returns a Record with the values to update and a slice of
field names to unset.

[source,go]
----
func (RecordSetType) (*RecordType, []models.FieldNamer)
----

NOTE: OnChange function is called only when the modification is done in the
interface, not by code.

IMPORTANT: OnChange methods are executed in an isolated environment that is
rolled back after execution. You should therefore not try to create or
write any RecordSet in these methods, or they will fail.

`Constraint` Methoder::
The method to call to validate the value of this field in a record.
The value must be a method on this RecordSet with the following
signature:

[source,go]
----
func (RecordSetType)
----

The given method must panic if the given RecordSet is not valid.

NOTE: Several fields can set their `Constraint:` to the same method. In this
case the method will only be called once, even if both fields are modified.

`GroupOperator` string::
A valid database function name that will be used on this field when aggregating
the model. It defaults to `sum`.

===== Computed fields parameters

`Compute` Methoder::
Declares this field as a computed field. The value must be a
method on this RecordSet with the following signature, which returns a
Record struct with the values to update.

[source,go]
----
func (RecordSetType) *RecordType
----

`Inverse` Methoder::
Declares an inverse method for a computed field. This method will be called when
the field is set and must write directly its changes to the database. The given
method must have the following signature:

[source,go]
----
func (RecordSetType, valueType)
----

where `valueType` is the go type for the given field value.

`Related` string::
Declares this field as a related field, i.e. a field that is automatically
synchronized with another field. The value must be a path string to the
related field starting from the current RecordSet
(e.g. `"Customer.Country.Name"`).

`Stored` bool::
For a computed field, if true then the field will be stored into the database.
Recomputation will be triggered by the data in the `Depends` parameter.
+
Storing a computed field allows to make queries on its value and speeds up
reading of the RecordSet. However, the updates can be slowed down,
especially when multiple triggers are fired at the same time.

`Depends` string::
Defines the fields on which to trigger recomputation of this field. This is
relevant only for computed fields with the `Stored` parameter set to true.
+
Value must be a comma separated list of paths to fields used in the
computation of this field. Paths may go through `one2many` or `many2many`
fields. In this case all the fields that would match will be used as triggers.

`Embed` bool::
Embed the model of the related field into this model. This field must be a
`many2one` field.
+
When embedded, all the fields of the RecordSet pointed by this field
will be automatically added as `Related` fields, so that they can be accessed
directly from this RecordSet.

NOTE: Only the fields of the embedded model will be accessible from this
model, not its methods.

==== Reserved field names

Fields that are given the following names will have special behaviours
described below.

`Name` CharField::
The Record's name. It will be used by default in user interfaces for display
when this Record is referred to (for instance as an FK of another model).
+
This behaviour can be changed by overriding the `NameGet` method of the model.

`Parent` Many2OneField::
Used in recursive models for the foreign key to this Record's parent Record of
the same model.

==== Setting constraints on fields

===== SQL constraints

SQL Constraints are managed by the following Model methods that must be run
before bootstrap.

`*(*Model) AddSQLConstraint(name, sql, errorString string)*`::
Adds an SQL constraint to this model. `name` is an arbitrary name to reference
this constraint. It will be appended by the table name in the database, so
there is only need to ensure that it is unique in this model. `sql` is
constraint definition to pass to the database. `errorString` is the text to
display to the user when the constraint is violated

`*(*Model) RemoveSQLConstraint(name)*`::
Removes the constraint previously created with the given name. This is
intended for use in a module that want to override the behaviour of a
previously installed other module.

=== Defining methods

Models' methods are defined in a module and can be overridden by any other
module, with the ability to call the original method through `Super()`. This
way, methods can be overridden several times by different modules to
iteratively add new features.

Each override of a method is declared by a so-called "layer function" with the
actual implementation. Layer functions must meet the following constraints:

* Its first argument is the method's receiver. It must be of the
`__RecordSetType__` of the model.
* It must panic when an error is encountered to force transaction rollback
(or solve the error directly if possible).

--

`*(*Method) DeclareMethod(doc string, layerFunction interface{}) *Method*`::
Declares a new method on this model and apply the given `layerFunction` as
first "layer function". `doc` is the documentation of the method.
+
This function should be called on a 'not-yet-created' instance of the method
we want to create. It is actually a placeholder, the code generation will make
the actual Method creation.

--

[source,go]
----
// Create a new method called 'UpdateBirthday' on the 'Partner' model
h.Partner().Methods().UpdateBirthday().DeclareMethod(
    `PartnerUpdateBirthday updates this partner birthday.`,
    func (rs PartnerSet, birthday time.Time) {
        rs.SetBirthday(Date(birthDay))
    })
----

`*(*Method) Extend(doc string, layerFunction interface{}) *Method*`::
Extends the method with the given `layerFunction`.
If `doc` is not the empty string, it is appended to the documentation of the
method.
+
The layer function should call itself on the RecordSet `Super()` object to
call the previous layer.

[source,go]
----
h.Partner().Methods().UpdateBirthday().Extend(
    `Extended in myModule to compute age at the same time.`,
    func(rs PartnerSet, birthday time.Time) {
        rs.Super().UpdateBirthday(birthday)
        rs.SetAge(Time.Now().Year() - birthday.Year())
    })
----

NOTE: The `functionLayer` passed to `Extend` must have the same signature
as that of the first layer passed to `DeclareMethod`.

`*(RecordSetType) Super() RecordSetType*`::
Returns a RecordSet with a modified callstack so that call to the current
method will execute the next method layer.
+
Calls to a different method than the current method will call its next layer
only if the current method has been called from a layer of the other method.
Otherwise, it will be the same as calling the other method directly.

=== Extending a model

Models can be extended by 3 different ways:

Extension::
Directly add fields and methods to existing models.

Mix In::
Add all fields and methods from a model to another model.

Embedding::
Allow direct access to all fields of another model. Embedding only applies to
fields, not methods.

==== Model Extension

See <<Fields declaration>> for how to add a field in a model. Fields can be
added to a model in any module, not only the module in which the model is
created.

See also <<Defining methods>> to see how to add or override methods in a model.

==== Model Mix In

`*(*Model) InheritModel(mixInModel *Model)*`::
Extend this model by importing all fields and methods of `mixInModel`.
`mixInModel` must have been created by `DeclareMixinModel()`.

If a field name conflicts with an existing field name in the model, then:

.Field overriding rules
- Fields defined in the target model override fields defined in any mixin model
- Fields defined in a mixin override fields defined in another mixin of same
priority (i.e. general or specific) imported before.

If a method name conflicts with an existing method name in the model, then:

.Method overriding rules
- Methods defined in the target model extend methods of the mixin model.
- Methods defined in a mixin extend methods defined of another mixin of same
priority (i.e. general or specific) imported before.

Use `Super()` in extending implementation to access the implementation of
the lower level mixins.

NOTE: When mixing in a model, the database columns are copied into the table of
the target model, resulting in an independent model. However, all extensions of
the mixin model are taken into account and apply to all the target models, even
if the extension has been defined after the mixing in.

==== Model Embedding

Model embedding allows a model to read fields of another model just as if they
were normal fields of the model.

To embed a model, define a `many2one` field pointing at the model to embed and
add the `embed` tag to it.

NOTE: Embedding does not allow direct access to the embedded model methods.

== Sequences
You can use the ORM to create and use custom sequences.

You can create a new database sequence with the `models.NewSequence()`
function. You can then use the `NextValue()` method to get the next value.

Use `models.MustGetSequence()` to retrieve a sequence.

NOTE: Since sequences are not rollbacked, several calls to `NextValue()` do
not necessarily give two following numbers.

[source,go]
----
seq := models.NewSequence("MySequence")

seq2 := models.MustGetSequence("MySequence")
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    val := seq2.NextValue()
    fmt.Println("Sequence: ", i, val)
}
