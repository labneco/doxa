= Data Loading

== Introduction
Doxa framework provides a way to load user space data directly into the database through the use of CSV files.

Doxa manages two kinds of data:

- Configuration data needed for the logic to work.
They are always loaded.
- Demo data needed either for evaluating the module or for use as test data.
Demo data is only loaded if the `Demo` configuration parameter is set to True.

== CSV Files
Configuration data must be put in the `data` subdirectory of a module, whereas demo data must be put in the `demo` subdirectory.

The files inside these subdirectories will be automatically loaded in the database by alphabetical order, following these
rules:

- The name of the CSV file must be the name of a model defined in the framework
either in this module or in dependencies of this module. Numbers and dashes at
the beginning of the file name are trimmed (used for sorting).
- The header line of the CSV defines the field names either as their real name
or their column (JSON) name.
- Each line is a record, with the values for each field.
- If an `ID` column is defined, it must be populated with a unique string for
each record known as its "external ID". If it is not defined, the framework
will provide one for each record.
- Foreign key fields must be set with the related record external ID
- Many-to-Many fields must be set with a `|` separated list of external IDs
- Binary fields must be set with the relative path (from this file's directory)
to a file with the binary content to load.

NOTE:: Files in the `demo` subdirectory will only be loaded if the `Demo` parameter is set in the config.

== Versions
Versions of data can be handled through the name of the CSV file.

- By default, if a record with the given external ID already exists, then the
line is silently discarded.
- If the CSV file name is postponed with `_` and a version number such as
`Model_3.csv`, a record with an existing external ID will be overridden only if
the version number of the file is above the version of the record in the
database. Records with non existing external ID will be inserted with the
version of the file name.
- If the CSV file name is postponed with `_update` such as `Model_update.csv`,
records with existing IDs are all overridden by the records in the file, and
their version number in the database is reset to 0.
