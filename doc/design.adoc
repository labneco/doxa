= Doxa's design choice

This document explains the design choices of Doxa, including the reason why we decided to write
Doxa in the first place.

== Introduction

We used Odoo (http://www.odoo.com[http://www.odoo.com]) for a few years to fulfil our customers need of business
applications. We are great fans of Odoo and managed to create applications for very different
businesses, from a 2 people service company to a 500 industrial company.

However, if Odoo is perfectly fitted for small and medium businesses it does not scale well
for bigger companies. When we say this, we don't mean that you can't have thousands of users
on odoo servers, Odoo's SaaS platform proves the contrary. We say that Odoo does not scale for
bigger companies because these companies need more business logic and calculations (such as
schedulers, reporting, etc.) and on much larger sets of data. With a 500 people company, we
feel we have reached the maximum of calculation power that Odoo could deliver.

So we decided to write Doxa to address this issue, with the following in mind:

- We want to keep the best from Odoo
- We want speed for the complex business logic calculation of medium and intermediate
businesses.

== Odoo features

If we want to keep the best from Odoo, we need to define what are, in our opinion, the great
features of this software.

=== Modular design

We believe that the success of Odoo among its partners and the opensource community is mainly
due to its full modular architecture. From the user point of view, this is interesting since
it allows to enable/disable features just by installing or uninstalling modules.

But it is, in our opinion, really from the developer point of view that this makes a
difference. Indeed, the theory of opensource is that you can modify a software to fit your
need. This is great, but doing so you actually create a fork and do not benefit automatically
from upstream updates. So in general very few people actually do it. The genius of Odoo's
modular architecture is that you don't need to make a fork to make a modification to the
application: you just have to create a module, and this module can modify any element of the
main application (models, views, controllers, client, â€¦) without touching a single line of
the original code.

This is definitely something we want to have in Doxa: *one should be able to customize Doxa by
creating a module without changing Doxa code.*

=== Large business code base

Over the years, Odoo's business code (i.e. business logic in add-ons) has grown so much that
it can handle business situations from sales to human resources through mrp and event
management. This large number of business applications and associated code is also part of
the success of Odoo.

This code base is so developed that it would take years rewriting it from scratch. Although
Doxa will not be written in python and its internals will be completely different from that
of Odoo, *Doxa will keep Odoo's business data model* so that modules can be easily ported
from Odoo to Doxa.

== Design choices

This section highlights design choices for Doxa that are different from that of Odoo. They
are all made in order to achieve a good speed in business logic calculation.

=== Go instead of Python

High calculation speed means a compiled language. Of course there are several workarounds
to speed up interpreted languages, but we're better of with the right tool at the
beginning rather than trying to make fixes all the time.

*Doxa will be written in GO* which is a compiled language known for its fast compilation
and execution, that is easy to learn and has some reflection capacities.

=== Static configuration

One of Odoo's feature is that all the configuration of the software is dynamic and held in
the database, such as installed modules, view definitions, etc. This is particularly
interesting for Odoo in a SaaS environment where several customers use the same Odoo instance
and each have its own database.

The drawback of this feature is that the database is constantly queried to get data that
hardly change over time. Due to its modular architecture, Odoo also needs to recompute the
elements (such as views) at each request by adding data from all the modules that impact this
element before sending it to the client. Here again, the data is the same at each request and
the calculation gives the same result each time.

*Doxa configuration data will be computed at compile time*. Only business configuration will
be dynamic and stored into the database. This means that a recompilation will be necessary
each time an element (view, model, controller) will be modified, but with go's quick
compilation this will not be a big issue.

This choice has several implications that should not be an issue for the target businesses:

- Installed modules will be determined at compile time, there is no one click install.
- A running Doxa instance will have all its database with the same configuration, so SaaS Doxa
will not be possible as it is in Odoo. Different configurations will mean different instances.

=== Developer friendly for high code quality

We believe that ERP systems are serious and need high code quality. We also believe that high
code quality is achieved, among others, by static types, attributes and methods that allow
many errors to be lifted at compile time.

*Doxa's business development API will be fully static*. This also allows common IDEs to make
reliable inspections and auto-completion. Developers won't have to lookup manually existing
fields or methods in a model, they will autocomplete nicely.
