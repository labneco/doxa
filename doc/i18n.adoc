== Introduction
Internationalization in Doxa groups several aspects:

- Translating the application so that the user sees the user interface in his own language.
- Displaying numbers, dates, currency amounts, etc. according to the user's locale
- Translating record data

=== Available languages
Available languages in the application are defined at startup by passing the `--languages` (or `-l`) flag with a comma separated list of language codes:

[source]
----
$ doxa server --languages fr,es,it,de
----

If a translation does not exist in the source code of one or several modules, then the original string in the default language is displayed (typically English).

== Application translation
This section covers translating the application, that all the text that will appear in the user interface.

The translation process is made of 4 stages:

- Define what needs to be translated
- Extract the PO files with the translation strings
- Translate the strings
- Load back the translation

=== Define what needs to be translated

Strings to be translated may appear in different contexts:

Strings in resources::
This includes strings in views, menus and actions.
No special action is needed here, Doxa knows by itself which strings are to be extracted from their XML definition.

Strings in model definition::
This includes model fields description and help strings, as well as Selection fields labels.
These are also extracted automatically without any special declaration.

Strings inside Go Code::
This includes strings that can be displayed to the client or to the log from inside a Go method.
To translate such strings, they need to be passed to the `T()` method of a RecordSet or a model:

[source,go]
----
h.OpenAcademyCourse().Methods().HelloWorld().DeclareMethod(
    `HelloWorld returns a localized "Hello World" message`,
    func(rs h.PartnerSet) string {
        return rs.T("Hello World")
    })

----

Strings inside client code::
This includes strings hardcoded into the client.
Since Doxa is client-agnostic, each client should register an extract function for their strings.

=== Extract the PO files
A PO file with all the strings to be translated can be created by the doxa command:

[source]
$ doxa i18n update path/to/a/module -l fr,it,de

The above command will create 3 files `fr.po`, `it.po` and `de.po` in the `i18n/` subdirectory of the module at `path/to/a/module`.
The `i18n/` subdirectory must exist prior to running `doxa i18n update`.

NOTE: If there is already a `XX.po` file in the `i18n/` directory, its translated strings will be kept in the newly generated PO file.

=== Translate the strings
PO files are a common translation file format and can be edited by many dedicated tools.

=== Load back the translation
No special step is necessary here other than a server restart with the newly translated language(s) set with the `--languages` flag.
