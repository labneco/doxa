== Prerequisites

This tutorial requires having installed Doxa <<install.adoc>>.

During this tutorial, you will create an `openacademy` module for managing
training courses. We create this module inside the doxa-demo directory:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/doxa-erp/doxa-demo
$ mkdir openacademy
----

Now we also need to declare our new module inside the `config/project.go` file.
Edit the file to make it look as follow:

.config/project.go
[source,go]
----
package project

// Import here anonymously all doxa addons you need in your application
import (
	// Import webclient module
	_ "github.com/doxa-erp/doxa-base/web"
	_ "github.com/doxa-erp/doxa-demo/openacademy"
)

NOTE: We highly recommend that you use a Go IDE or editor with autocompletion
to benefit from the static typing of the Doxa framework.

----

NOTE: All file paths in this tutorial are relative to the
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/doxa-erp/doxa-demo` directory.

== Start/Stop the Doxa server

Doxa uses a client/server architecture in which clients are web browsers
accessing the Doxa server via RPC.

Business logic and extension is generally performed on the server side,
although supporting client features (e.g. new data representation such as
interactive maps) can be added to the client.

In order to start the server, simply invoke the command `doxa server`
in the shell. Add the `-o` flag to have the logs printed to the standard
output.

The server is stopped by hitting ``Ctrl-C`` from the terminal, or by
killing the corresponding OS process.

== Build an Doxa module

Both server and client extensions are packaged as *modules*.

Doxa modules can either add brand new business logic to an Doxa system, or
alter and extend existing business logic: a module can be created to add your
country's accounting rules to Doxa's generic accounting support, while the
next module adds support for real-time visualisation of a bus fleet.

Everything in Doxa thus starts and ends with modules.

=== Composition of a module

An Doxa module can contain a number of elements:

Business objects::
Declared in Go code, these resources are automatically persisted by Doxa based
on their configuration

View files::
XML files declaring views, actions and menus

Data files::
CSV files declaring configuration data (modules parameterization)

Web controllers::
Handle requests from web browsers

Static web data::
Images, CSS or javascript files used by the web interface or website

=== Module structure

Each module is a directory which is also a Go package. Optionally, a module
may contain other Go packages as subdirectories of the main module.

An Doxa module is declared by code. By convention, this is in a file called
`doxa.go`. The declaration consists in:

- defining a `MODULE_NAME` string content with the module's name
- registering the module with the `RegisterModule()` function.

Let's create an `doxa.go` inside the `doxa-demo/openacademy` folder we
created above:

.openacademy/doxa.go
[source,go]
----
package openacademy

import (
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/doxa/server"
)

const MODULE_NAME string = "openacademy"

func init() {
    server.RegisterModule(&server.Module{
		Name: MODULE_NAME,
		PreInit: func() {},
		PostInit: func() {},
	})
}
----

The declared `PreInit` and `PostInit` functions allows to execute some code at server startup.

- `PreInit` is run after all models are declared and configuration is loaded but before bootstrapping.
- `PostInit` is run after the models, views and controllers are bootstrapped.
We leave them as empty functions for the moment.

== Object-Relational Mapping

A key component of Doxa is the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer.
This layer avoids having to write most SQL by hand and provides extensibility
and security services.

=== Models

Business objects are declared in Go code and the framework integrates them into
the automated persistence system. They must be declared either :

- in an `init()` function of the package at the module root
- in an `init()` function of a package in a subdirectory of the module, with
this package imported in the root package.
- in a function called by one of the above-mentioned `init()`

To put it short, the models definition must be read at the program startup
during the module loading phase
(see also https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#init)

Let's create a new `OpenAcademyCourse` model in our *openacademy* module. We will do it
in a new file named `course.go`, but it could have been done in any file of
the module.

.openacademy/course.go
[source,go]
----
package openacademy

import (
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/doxa/models"
)

func init() {
    h.OpenAcademyCourse().DeclareModel()
}
----

[NOTE]
====
`DeclareModel` is called on our new not-yet-created model instance. This
is because the above statement is a placeholder. The actual model declaration
will be automatically generated by `doxa generate` command.
====

=== Code generation

In order to use our newly created model, we need to generate the code that
will provide the structs and methods of this model.

This is done with the `doxa generate` command that must be executed at the
project's root (i.e. `$GOPATH/src/github.com/doxa-erp/doxa-demo`).

[source,bash]
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/doxa-erp/doxa-demo
$ doxa generate
----

This command will output several warnings during its execution. Just check
that it terminated correctly:

[source]
----
(...)
Generating pool...Ok
Checking the generated code...Ok
Pool generated successfully
----

After generation, our models can be accessed in the `h` package.

[IMPORTANT]
====
`doxa generate` must be called before starting the server or synchronizing the
database whenever there is a modification in a model definition, i.e.:

- A model is created or removed
- A field is added or removed
- A method is added or removed
====

=== Model fields

Fields are used to define what the model can store and where. Fields are
defined by the `AddField` method of the model.

Update the `OpenAcademyCourse` model to include a name and a description to our course.

.openacademy/course.go
[source,go]
----
package openacademy

import (
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/doxa/models"
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/pool/h" // <1>
)

func init() {
    h.OpenAcademyCourse().DeclareModel()
    h.OpenAcademyCourse().AddFields(map[string]models.FieldDefinition{
        "Name":        models.CharField{},
        "Description": models.TextField{},
    })
}
----
<1> Note that we need to import the generated `h` package to use it

==== Common Attributes

Fields can be configured, by passing configuration attributes in the params
struct:

[source,go]
----
"Name":  models.CharField{Required: true},
----

Some attributes are available on all fields, here are the most common ones:

====
String::
The label of the field in UI (visible by users). Defaults to the field's name
with spaces before capital letters (`SaleOrder` => `Sale Order`)
Required::
If `true`, the field can not be empty, it must either have a default
value or always be given a value when creating a record.
Help::
Long-form, provides a help tooltip to users in the user interface.
Index::
Requests that Doxa create a database index on the column.
====

==== Simple fields

There are two broad categories of fields: "simple" fields which are atomic
values stored directly in the model's table and "relational" fields linking
records (of the same model or of different models).

Example of simple fields are `Boolean`, `Date`, `Char`.

==== Reserved fields

Doxa creates a few fields in all models. These fields are managed by the
framework and shouldn't be written to. They can be read if useful or
necessary:

====
ID::
The unique identifier for a record in its model.
CreateDate::
Creation date of the record.
CreateUID::
User who created the record.
WriteDate::
Last modification date of the record.
WriteUID::
User who last modified the record.
LastUpdate::
Last time the record was updated (`max(CreateDate, WriteDate)`).
DisplayName::
The name to display when this record is refered to.
DoxaExternalID::
The external ID that is used when importing/exporting data
DoxaVersion::
The version of the record data used when updating data
====

==== Special fields

By default, Doxa also requires a `Name` field on all models that will be used
as default for `DisplayName`. This behaviour can be changed by overriding the
`NameGet()` method of a model.

== Resource files

Doxa is a highly data driven system. Although behavior is customized using
Go code, some data can be defined in resource files instead for a better
readability. They are:

- Actions
- Menus
- Views

These resources are XML files that must be put in the `resources` subdirectory
of the module. The framework automatically scans the `resources` directory,
there is no need to declare the files.

Create a `resources` subdirectory in our `openacademy` module and a
`course.xml` file inside with the following content:

.openacademy/resources/course.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<doxa>
    <data>

    </data>
</doxa>
----

Action, menus and view definitions will come inside the `data` tag.

=== Actions
Actions define the behavior of the system in response to user actions: login,
action button, selection of an invoice, ...
They can be triggered in three ways:

- by clicking on menu items (linked to specific actions)
- by clicking on buttons in views (if these are connected to actions)
- as contextual actions on object

The main types of actions are:
====
Window action::
Opens a specific view in the client
Server action::
Execute a method on a model on the server
Report action::
Generate and return a report
====

Create a window action to access our Course (inside the `data` tag):

.openacademy/resources/course.xml
[source,xml]
----
(...)
<action id="openacademy_course_action" name="Courses" model="OpenAcademyCourse"
        view_mode="tree,form" type="ir.actions.act_window">
    <help>
        <p class="oe_view_nocontent_create">Create the first course</p>
    </help>
</action>
(...)
----

NOTE: By convention, ids in XML files should start with the module name.

=== Menus

Menus trigger actions when they are clicked. Menus can have a parent to create
a menu hierarchy.

Let's create menus for our Courses action. Add the `menuitem` tags inside the
`data` tags after the `action` block.

.openacademy/resources/course.xml
[source,xml]
----
(...)
<menuitem id="openacademy_main_menu" name="Open Academy"/>

<menuitem id="openacademy_menu" name="Open Academy" parent="openacademy_main_menu"/>

<menuitem id="openacademy_course_menu" name="Courses" parent="openacademy_menu"
          action="openacademy_course_action"/>
(...)
----

NOTE: XML files are all loaded before being processed. Therefore, there is no
need to declare resources in a specific order. For instance, menus can refer
to actions that are defined afterwards or in another file or module.

=== Views

See next section for view definitions.

== Basic views

Views define the way the records of a model are displayed. Each type of view
represents a mode of visualization (a list of records, a graph of their
aggregation, …). Views can either be requested generically via their type
(e.g. *a list of partners*) or specifically via their id. For generic
requests, the view with the correct type and the lowest priority will be
used (so the lowest-priority view of each type is the default view for that
type).

View inheritance allows altering views declared elsewhere (adding or removing
content).

=== Generic view declaration

A view is declared with the `view` tag. The basic view types are: list, form
and search views.

==== List views

List views, also called tree views, display records in a tabular form. Their
root element is `<tree>`.

Create a simple list view that only displays one column with the name of the
course:

.openacademy/resources/course.xml
[source,xml]
----
(...)
<view id="openacademy_course_tree" model="OpenAcademyCourse">
    <tree>
        <field name="Name"/>
    </tree>
</view>
(...)
----

=== Form views

Forms are used to create and edit single records. Their root element is
`<form>`. They are composed of high-level structure elements (groups,
notebooks) and interactive elements (buttons and fields).

Create a form for our Course model:

.openacademy/resources/course.xml
[source,xml]
----
(...)
<view id="openacademy_course_form" model="OpenAcademyCourse">
    <form>
        <sheet>
            <group>
                <field name="Name"/>
            </group>
            <notebook>
                <page string="Description">
                    <field name="Description"/>
                </page>
                <page string="About">
                    This is an example of notebooks
                </page>
            </notebook>
        </sheet>
    </form>
</view>
(...)
----

Form views can also use plain HTML for more flexible layouts:

.Form view with plain HTML

====
[source,xml]
----
    <form string="Idea Form">
        <header>
            <button string="Confirm" type="object" name="ActionConfirm"
                    states="draft" class="oe_highlight" />
            <button string="Mark as done" type="object" name="ActionDone"
                    states="confirmed" class="oe_highlight"/>
            <button string="Reset to draft" type="object" name="ActionDraft"
                    states="confirmed,done" />
            <field name="State" widget="statusbar"/>
        </header>
        <sheet>
            <div class="oe_title">
                <label for="Name" class="oe_edit_only" string="Idea Name" />
                <h1><field name="Name" /></h1>
            </div>
            <separator string="General" colspan="2" />
            <group colspan="2" col="2">
                <field name="Description" placeholder="Idea description..." />
            </group>
        </sheet>
    </form>
----
====

=== Search views

Search views customize the search field associated with the list view (and
other aggregated views). Their root element is `<search>` and they're
composed of fields defining which fields can be searched on.

Let's create a search view on our Course model to search on a course name or
description.

.openacademy/resources/course.xml
[source,xml]
----
(...)
<view id="openacademy_course_search" model="OpenAcademyCourse">
    <search>
        <field name="Name"/>
        <field name="Description"/>
    </search>
</view>
(...)
----

If no search view exists for the model, Doxa generates one which only allows
searching on the ``name`` field.

== Synchronising the database and starting the server

At this stage, we have created:

- An `OpenAcademyCourse` model with two fields `Name` and `Description`
- A list view, a form view and a search view for our model
- A menu and an action to access our model in the interface

To test our development, we can now synchronise the database with our model
definitions using the `doxa updatedb` command in the project root directory.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/doxa-erp/doxa-demo
$ doxa updatedb -o
----

The `-o` flag displays the log to the standard output.

When the database is synchronised, we can start the server to see our Course
model in action.

[source,bash]
----
$ doxa server -o
----

Now open your favorite web browser to http://localhost:8080 to access the
application. Default credentials are:

====
[horizontal]
User:: admin
Password:: admin
====

You should see on the top menu bar an `Open Academy` menu and a `Courses`
menu on the left. Check that you can create, update, search and delete
courses through the interface.

[IMPORTANT]
====
- Update the database each time you modify a model (add, remove or modify a
field)
- Restart the server each time you make a modification to see it applied
====

TIP: By adding a `?debug` param in the address bar, you switch to developer
mode in the UI, and will provide interesting information as tooltip when you
hover a field's label.

== Relations between models

A record from a model may be related to a record from another model. For
instance, a sale order record is related to a client record that contains the
client data; it is also related to its sale order line records.

For the module Open Academy, we consider a model for *sessions*: a session
is an occurrence of a course taught at a given time for a given audience.

Let's create a model for *sessions*. A session has a name, a start date, a
duration and a number of seats. Although we could have used the same file
we will create a new file for sessions to organise our code.

NOTE: Don't forget to run `doxa generate` and `doxa updatedb` after creating
the new model

.openacademy/session.go
[source,go]
----
package openacademy

import (
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/doxa/models"
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/doxa/models/types"
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/pool/h"
)

func init() { // <1>
    h.OpenAcademySession().DeclareModel()
    h.OpenAcademySession().AddFields(map[string]models.FieldDefinition{
        "Name":      models.CharField{Required: true},
        "StartDate": models.DateField{},
        "Duration":  models.FloatField{Digits: nbutils.Digits{Precision: 6, Scale: 2},
            Help: "Duration in days"},
        "Seats":     models.IntegerField{String: "Number of seats"},
        "State":     models.SelectionField{
            Selection: types.Selection{"planned": "Planned", "in_progress":"In Progress", "done": "Finished"}}, //<2>
    })
}
----
<1> You can define as many `init()` functions in a Go package
<2> A `Selection` field takes a value from a fixed list

NOTE: `nbutils.Digits{Precision: 6, Scale: 2}` specifies the precision of a float
number: 6 is the total number of digits, while 2 is the number of digits after
the decimal point. Note that it results in the number digits before the decimal
point is maximum 4.

Now we create an action and menu to display our sessions. Here again, we will
create a new file to organise our code, though this is not mandatory.

.openacademy/resources/session.xml
[source,xml]
----
<doxa>
    <data>

        <view id="openacademy_session_tree" model="OpenAcademySession">
            <tree>
                <field name="Name"/>
                <field name="StartDate"/>
            </tree>
        </view>

        <view id="openacademy_session_form" model="OpenAcademySession">
            <form string="Session Form">
                <header>
                    <field name="State" widget="statusbar"/>
                </header>
                <sheet>
                    <group>
                        <field name="Name"/>
                        <field name="StartDate"/>
                        <field name="Duration"/>
                        <field name="Seats"/>
                    </group>
                </sheet>
            </form>
        </view>

        <action id="openacademy_sessions_action" name="Sessions" model="OpenAcademySession"
                type="ir.actions.act_window" view_mode="tree,form"/>

        <menuitem id="openacademy_session_menu" name="Sessions"
                  parent="openacademy_menu" action="openacademy_sessions_action"/>

    </data>
</doxa>
----

=== Relational fields

Relational fields link records, either of the same model (hierarchies) or
between different models.

Relational field types are:

Many2One::
A simple link to another object.

[source,go]
----
h.SaleOrder().AddFields(map[string]models.FieldDefinition{
    "Customer": models.Many2OneField{RelationModel: h.Partner()},
})

fmt.Println(myOrder().Customer().Name())
----

One2Many::
A virtual relationship, inverse of a `Many2one`. A `One2many` behaves as a
container of records, accessing its results in a (possibly empty) set of
records.

[source,go]
----
h.SaleOrder().AddFields(map[string]models.FieldDefinition{
    "OrderLines": models.One2ManyField{RelationModel: h.SaleOrderLine(), ReverseFK: "Order"},
})

for _, orderLine := range myOrder().OrderLines().Records() {
    fmt.Println(orderLine.AmountTotal())
}
----

IMPORTANT: Because a `One2many` is a virtual relationship, there *must* be a
`Many2one` field in the other model and its name *must* be the name defined by
`ReverseFK`.

Many2Many::
Bidirectional multiple relationship, any record on one side can be related
to any number of records on the other side. Behaves as a container of records,
accessing it also results in a possibly empty set of records.

[source,go]
----
h.SaleOrder().AddFields(map[string]models.FieldDefinition{
    "Tags": models.Many2ManyField{RelationModel: h.Tag()},
})

for _, tag := range myOrder().Tags().Records() {
    fmt.Println(tag.Name())
}
----

Let's add relations to our Course and Session models.

.openacademy/course.go
[source,go]
----
package openacademy

import (
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/doxa/models"
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/pool/h"
)

func init() {
    h.OpenAcademyCourse().DeclareModel()
    h.OpenAcademyCourse().AddFields(map[string]models.FieldDefinition{
        "Name":        models.CharField{},
        "Description": models.TextField{},
        "Responsible": models.Many2OneField{
            RelationModel: h.User(), OnDelete: models.SetNull, Index: true},
        "Sessions":    models.One2ManyField{
            RelationModel: h.OpenAcademySession(), ReverseFK: "Course"},
    })
}
----

.openacademy/session.go
[source,go]
----
package openacademy

import (
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/doxa/models"
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/doxa/models/types"
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/pool/h"
)

func init() {
    h.OpenAcademySession().DeclareModel()
    h.OpenAcademySession().AddFields(map[string]models.FieldDefinition{
        "Name":       models.CharField{Required: true},
        "StartDate":  models.DateField{},
        "Duration":   models.FloatField{Digits: nbutils.Digits{Precision: 6, Scale: 2},
            Help: "Duration in days"},
        "Seats":      models.IntegerField{String: "Number of seats"},
        "State":      models.SelectionField{
            Selection: types.Selection{"planned": "Planned", "in_progress":"In Progress", "done": "Finished"}}, //<2>
        "Instructor": models.Many2OneField{RelationModel: h.Partner()},
        "Course":     models.Many2OneField{RelationModel: h.OpenAcademyCourse(),
            Required: true, OnDelete: models.Cascade},
        "Attendees":  models.Many2ManyField{RelationModel: h.Partner()},
    })
}
----

Now we update their views accordingly.

== Inheritance

=== Model inheritance

Doxa provides two *inheritance* mechanisms to extend an existing model in a
modular way: extension and embedding.

Extension allows a module to modify the behavior of a model defined in another
module:

- add fields to a model,
- override the definition of fields on a model,
- add constraints to a model,
- add methods to a model,
- override existing methods on a model.

Embedding allows to link every record of a model to a record in a parent model,
and provides transparent access to the fields of the parent record.

=== View inheritance

Instead of modifying existing views in place (by overwriting them), Doxa
provides view inheritance where children "extension" views are applied on top
of root views, and can add or remove content from their parent.

An extension view references its parent using the `inherit_id` attribute
instead of the `id` attribute. Instead of a single view its content field is
composed of any number of `xpath` elements selecting and altering the content
of their parent view.

.View inheritance
====
[source,xml]
----
    <view inherit_id="id_category_list" model="IdeaCategory">
        <!-- find field Description and add the field Ideas after it -->
        <xpath expr="//field[@name='Description']" position="after">
          <field name="Ideas" string="Number of ideas"/>
        </xpath>
    </view>
----
====

expr::
    An `XPath` expression selecting a single element in the parent view.
    Raises an error if it matches no element or more than one

position::
    Operation to apply to the matched element. Possible operations are:

====
inside::
Appends `xpath`'s body at the end of the matched element
replace::
Replaces the matched element with the `xpath`'s body, replacing any `$0` node
occurrence in the new body with the original element
before::
Inserts the `xpath`'s body as a sibling before the matched element
after::
Inserts the `xpaths`'s body as a sibling after the matched element
attributes::
Alters the attributes of the matched element using special `attribute`
elements in the `xpath`'s body
====

[TIP]
====
When matching a single element, the `position` attribute can be set directly
on the element to be found. Both inheritances below will give the same result.

[source,xml]
----
        <xpath expr="//field[@name='Description']" position="after">
            <field name="Ideas" />
        </xpath>

        <field name="Description" position="after">
            <field name="Ideas" />
        </field>
----
====

=== Example

Let's modify the existing `Partner` model (defined in Doxa's `base` module)
to add an `instructor` boolean field, and a Many2Many field that corresponds to
the session-partner relation.

.openacademy/partner.go
[source,go]
----
package openacademy

import (
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/doxa/models"
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/pool/h"
)

func init() {
    h.Partner().AddFields(map[string]models.FieldDefinition{
        "Instructor":       models.BooleanField{},
        "AttendedSessions": models.Many2ManyField{RelationModel: h.OpenAcademySession()}
    })
}
----

.openacademy/resources/partner.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<doxa>
    <data>

        <!-- Add instructor field to existing view -->
        <view inherit_id="base_view_partner_form" model="Partner">
            <notebook position="inside">
                <page string="Sessions">
                    <group>
                        <field name="Instructor"/>
                        <field name="Sessions"/>
                    </group>
                </page>
            </notebook>
        </view>

        <action id="openacademy_partners_action" model="Partner"
                view_mode="tree,form" type="ir.actions.act_window"/>

        <menuitem id="openacademy_configuration_menu" name="Configuration"
                  parent="openacademy_main_menu"/>
        <menuitem id="openacademy_contact_menu" name="Contacts"
                  parent="openacademy_configuration_menu"
                  action="openacademy_partners_action"/>

    </data>
</doxa>
----

=== Conditions on related fields

Doxa allows to limit the list of available record candidates for a relation.
For example, in our Open Academy, for a session, we want to be able to select
an instructor only among partners that have the boolean field `Instructor` set
to true.

**Not yet implemented**

== Model methods

With Doxa, you can define methods on models to implement business logic.

Methods are created by `DeclareMethod()`:

.Creating a method
====
[source,go]
----
h.OpenAcademyCourse().Methods().StartSession().DeclareMethod(
    `StartSession sets the State of the Session to 'Started'`,
    func(rs h.OpenAcademyCourseSet) {
        // Update State for all record in rs
        rs.SetState("in_progress")
    })

// calling the method somewhere else
myCourseSet.StartSession()
----
====

[NOTE]
====
`DeclareMethod` is called on our new not-yet-created method instance. This
is because the above statement is a placeholder. The actual method creation
will be automatically generated by `doxa generate` command.
====

NOTE: `h.OpenAcademyCourseSet` is the record set type for the `OpenAcademyCourse`
model. It holds a set of `OpenAcademyCourse` records. All model methods are
called on (possibly empty) record sets.

Methods can be overridden in other modules with `Extend()` on the method
object. Call `rs.Super().MyMethod()` to execute the original implementation.

.Overridding/Extending a method
====
[source,go]
----
h.OpenAcademyCourse().Methods().StartSession().Extend("",
    func(rs h.OpenAcademyCourseSet) {
        rs.Super().StartSession()
        fmt.Println("Session started")
    })
----
====

== Computed fields and default values

So far fields have been stored directly in and retrieved directly from the
database. Fields can also be *computed*. In that case, the field's value is not
retrieved from the database but computed on-the-fly by calling a method of the
model.

To create a computed field, create a field and set its attribute `Compute` to
a method. The computation method should have the following signature:

[source,go]
func (RecordSet) *RecordData

`RecordSet` type depends on the model and is named `ModelSet` for model `Model`
(e.g. `OpenAcademySessionSet`)

NOTE: In the case of a computation method, the given record set is a singleton.

`RecordData` type is a struct with all the fields of the model to hold a
record. It is named `ModelData` for model `Model` (e.g.
`OpenAcademySessionData`)

=== Dependencies

The value of a computed field usually depends on the values of other fields on
the computed record. The ORM expects the developer to specify those dependencies
on the compute method by specifying the `Depends` attribute of the field.
The given dependencies are used by the ORM to trigger the recomputation of the
field whenever some of its dependencies have been modified.

Let's add the percentage of taken seats to the *Session* model.

.openacademy/session.go
[source,go]
----
func init() {
(...)
    "TakenSeats": models.FloatField{
        Compute: h.OpenAcademySession().Methods().ComputeTakenSeats(),
        Depends: []string{"Seats", "Attendees"}},

(...)

    h.OpenAcademySession().Methods().ComputeTakenSeats().DeclareMethod(
        `ComputeTakenSeats returns the percentage of taken seats in this session`,
        func(rs h.OpenAcademySessionSet) *h.OpenAcademySessionData {
            var res h.OpenAcademySessionData
            // res struct fields default to their Go zero value
            if rs.Seats() != 0 {
                res.TakenSeats = 100.0 * float64(rs.Attendees().Len()) / float64(rs.Seats())
            }
            return &res
        })
(...)
}
----

Now let's add our new field in the form and tree views:

.openacademy/resources/session.xml
[source,go]
----
(...tree view...)
            <tree string="Session Tree">
                <field name="Name"/>
                <field name="Course"/>
                <field name="TakenSeats" widget="progressbar"/>
            </tree>
        </view>
(...)

(...form view...)
                <field name="StartDate"/>
                <field name="Duration"/>
                <field name="Seats"/>
                <field name="TakenSeats" widget="progressbar"/>
            </group>
        </group>
        <label for="Attendees"/>
(...)
----

=== Default values

Any field can be given a default value. In the field definition, add the option
`Default: X` where `X` is a function with the following signature:

[source,go]
func (models.Environment) interface{}

The default function is called when providing an empty form in the user interface during record creation.

[NOTE]
====
The `Environment` object gives access to request parameters and other useful
things. The current Environment can be retrieved from a record set with the
`Env()` method.

- `rs.Env().Cr()` is the database *cursor* object; it is used for querying the
database directly.
- `rs.Env().Uid()` is the current user's database id
- `rs.Env().Context()` is the context dictionary
====

TIP: For a constant default value, the `models` package provides a
`DefaultValue` function that takes the constant as single argument and returns
a suitable function for `Default:`

Now we will set `StartDate` default value to today, and create a new `Active`
field that defaults to true.

.openacademy/session.go
[source,go]
----
func init() {
(...)
    "StartDate": models.DateField{
        Default: func(env models.Environment) interface{} {
                return dates.Today()
            },
        },
(...)
    "Active": models.BooleanField{Default: models.DefaultValue(true)},
(...)
}
----

== Onchange

The "onchange" mechanism provides a way for the client interface to update a
form whenever the user has filled in a value in a field, without saving anything
to the database.

To achieve this, set the `OnChange:` parameter of the field with a computation
function.

Such fonction have the following signature:

[source,go]
func (RecordSet) (*RecordData, []models.FieldNamer)

For computed fields, valued `onchange` behavior is built-in as can be seen by
playing with the *Session* form: change the number of seats or participants, and
the `TakenSeats` progressbar is automatically updated.

We now add an explicit onchange to prevent negative number of seats.

.openacademy/session.go
[source,go]
----
func init() {
(...)
    "Seats": models.IntegerField{
        String: "Number of seats",
        OnChange: h.OpenAcademySession().Methods().VerifyValidSeats()},
(...)
   "Attendees": models.Many2ManyField{
        RelationModel: h.Partner(),
        OnChange: h.OpenAcademySession().Methods().VerifyValidSeats()},
(...)

    h.OpenAcademySession().Methods().VerifyValidSeats().DeclareMethod(
        `VerifyValidSeats checks that the number of seats is positive
        and resets it to zero otherwise`,
        func (rs h.OpenAcademySessionSet) (*h.OpenAcademySessionData, []models.FieldNamer) {
            var fieldsToReset []models.FieldNamer
            if rs.Seats() < 0 {
                fieldsToReset = []models.FieldNamer{h.OpenAcademySession().Seats()}
            }
            return &res, fieldsToReset
        })
(...)
}
----

It is also possible to send a warning or a new domain to the UI when a field
is changed:

**Not yet implemented**

== Model constraints

=== Filtering Relation Record Candidates

A `Filter` parameter can be added to relational fields to limit valid records
for the relation when trying to select records in the client interface. This
parameter takes a condition on the relation model.
Conditions are built with the `q` package

We can add a domain to limit instructors to partners who are instructors:

.openacademy/session.go
[source,go]
----
import (
(...)
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/pool/q"
)
(...)
    "Instructor": models.Many2OneField{RelationModel: h.Partner(),
        Filter: q.Partner().Instructor().Equals(true)},
(...)
----

=== SQL Constraints

You can add SQL constraints to a model with the `AddSQLConstraint()` method of
a Model. This method takes a name for the constraint, the SQL code to enforce
and a string to display to the user when the constraint is violated.

Unique constraints on a single field can also be specified by setting the
`Unique:` parameter of the field's declaration to true.

Let's add the following SQL constraints to our sessions:

- CHECK that the course description and the course title are different
- Make the Course's name UNIQUE

.openacademy/course.go
[source,go]
----
(...)
    "Name": models.CharField{Unique: true},
(...)
    h.OpenAcademyCourse().AddSQLConstraint("name_description_check",
         "CHECK(name != description)",
         "The title of the course should not be the description")
(...)
----

=== Constraint by method

Constraints on models can also be defined as methods on models. This is done by
setting the `Constraint:` parameter of a field to a method that
will check if its given recordset is valid. This method must panic if it is not
the case.

NOTE: Several fields can set their `Constraint:` to the same method. In this
case the method will only be called once, even if both fields are modified.

Now we will add a constraint that checks that the instructor is not present
in the attendees of his/her own session.

.openacademy/session.go
[source,go]
----
(...)
    "Instructor": models.Many2OneField{RelationModel: h.Partner(),
        Filter: q.Partner().Instructor().Equals(true),
        Constraint: h.OpenAcademySession().Methods().CheckInstructorNotInAttendees()},
    "Attendees": models.Many2ManyField{RelationModel: h.Partner(),
        OnChange: h.OpenAcademySession().Methods().VerifyValidSeats(),
        Constraint: h.OpenAcademySession().Methods().CheckInstructorNotInAttendees()},

(...)

    h.OpenAcademySession().Methods().CheckInstructorNotInAttendees().DeclareMethod(
        `CheckInstructorNotInAttendees checks that the instructor is not present
        in the attendees of his/her own session`,
        func(rs h.OpenAcademySessionSet) {
            for _, attendee := range rs.Attendees().Records() {
                if attendee.ID() == rs.Instructor().ID() {
                    panic("The session's instructor can't be an attendee of his own session")
                }
            }
        })
(...)
----

== Advanced Views

=== List views

List views can take supplementary attributes to further customize their
behavior:

decoration-{$name}::
Allows changing the style of a row's text based on the corresponding
record's attributes.
+
Values are Python expressions. For each record, the expression is evaluated
with the record's attributes (by their JSON names) as context values and if
`true`, the corresponding style is applied to the row. Other context values
are `uid` (the id of the current user) and `current_date` (the current date
as a string of the form `yyyy-MM-dd`).
+
[NOTE]
====
Each field definition has a name and a so-called JSON name which is the
name of the column in the database and the field name sent to the client.

If not specificied in the field definition, the JSON name defaults to the
snake case value of the field's name, with the following subtilties:

- It is Go camel case aware: `DescriptionHTML` => `description_html`
- Many2One fields are appended `_id`: `Partner` => `partner_id`
- One2Many and Many2many are appended `_ids`: `OrderLines` => `order_lines_ids`
====
+
IMPORTANT: All field values that are evaluated must appear in the tree view,
possibly with an `invisible="1"` attribute, if you don't want it displayed.
+
`{$name}` can be `bf` (`font-weight: bold`), `it`
(`font-style: italic`), or any bootstrap contextual color
(http://getbootstrap.com/components/#available-variations: `danger`,
`info`, `muted`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`).
+
.List view with specified row styles
====
[source,xml]
----
    <tree string="Idea Categories" decoration-info="state=='draft'"
        decoration-danger="state=='trashed'">
        <field name="Name"/>
        <field name="State"/>
    </tree>
----
====

editable::
Either `"top"` or `"bottom"`. Makes the tree view editable in-place
(rather than having to go through the form view), the value is the
position where new rows appear.


Let's color our Session tree view in such a way that sessions lasting less than
5 days are colored blue, and the ones lasting more than 15 days are colored
red:

[source,xml]
----
(...)
        <view  id="openacademy_session_tree" model="OpenAcademySession">
            <tree string="Session Tree" decoration-info="duration&lt;5" decoration-danger="duration&gt;15">
                <field name="Name"/>
                <field name="Course"/>
                <field name="Duration" invisible="1"/>
                <field name="TakenSeats" widget="progressbar"/>
            </tree>
        </view>
(...)
----

=== Calendars

**Not yet implemented**

=== Search views

Search view `<field>` elements can have a `filter_domain` attribute that
overrides the condition generated for searching on the given field. In the
given domain, `self` represents the value entered by the user.

[NOTE]
====
As Doxa uses Odoo web client, conditions on client side are defined by
so-called "domains". See the following links for more documentation:

- https://www.odoo.com/documentation/10.0/howtos/backend.html#domains
- https://www.odoo.com/documentation/10.0/reference/orm.html#reference-orm-domains
====
Search views can also contain `<filter>` elements, which act as toggles for
predefined searches. Filters must have one of the following attributes:

`domain`::
Search condition to apply when the filter is activated

`context`::
Add some context to the current search; use the key ``group_by`` to group
results on the given field name

To use a non-default search view in an action, it should be linked using the
`search_view_id` attribute of the action record.

The action can also set default values for search fields through its
`context` field: context keys of the form `search_default_{field_name}` will
initialize *field_name* with the provided value. Search filters must have an
optional `name` to have a default and behave as booleans (they can only be
enabled by default).

Now we will

- Add a button to filter the courses for which the current user is the
responsible in the course search view. Make it selected by default.
- Add a button to group courses by responsible user.

.openacademy/resources/course.xml
[source,xml]
----
(...)
            <search>
                <field name="Name"/>
                <field name="Description"/>
                <filter name="my_courses" string="My Courses"
                        domain="[('responsible_id', '=', uid)]"/>
                <group string="Group By">
                    <filter name="by_responsible" string="Responsible"
                            context='{"group_by": "responsible_id"}'/>
                </group>
            </search>

policy.

=== Group-based access control mechanisms

Groups are created by code and registered in the framework like this:

[source,go]
----
myGroup := security.NewGroup("my_group", "My Group")
security.Registry.RegisterGroup(newGroup)
----

They can be retrieved by id this way:

[source,go]
myGroup := security.Registry.GetGroup("my_group")

But it is good practice to define each group as package level variables in
the module that registers it, so that other modules can import and use the
variable directly, such as `base.GroupUser`.

Groups are granted menu access via menu definitions. However even without a
menu, objects may still be accessible indirectly, so actual object-level
permissions must be defined for groups.

Unlike other systems, there is no CRUD permissions on objects. Instead,
execution permission is granted to groups on a per-method basis. Classical
CRUD access control is possible by granting execution on `Create`, `Load`,
`Write` and `Unlink` methods of a model.

It is also possible to restrict access to specific fields on a view or object
using the field's groups attribute.

=== Method Execution Control

By default, only members of `security.AdminGroup` are allowed to execute a
method. Other groups should be manually added to allowed groups.

This is done with `AllowGroup()` applied on a method object.

NOTE: With the helper method `AllowAllToGroup()` applied on the method
collection of an object, we can grant access to all methods of a model at once
to a group, including methods that are not yet declared.

Now we create :

- a group "OpenAcademy / Session Read" with read access to the *Session*
model.
- a group "OpenAcademy / Manager" with full access to our models

.openacademy/doxa.go
[source,go]
----
package openacademy

import (
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/doxa/models/security"
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/doxa/server"
)

const MODULE_NAME string = "openacademy"

var (
    SessionRead *security.Group
    Manager     *security.Group
)

func init() {
    server.RegisterModule(&server.Module{
		Name: MODULE_NAME,
		PreInit: func() {},
		PostInit: func() {},
	})
}
----

.openacademy/course.go
[source,go]
----
func init() {
    (...)
    SessionRead = security.Registry.NewGroup("openacademy_session_read", "OpenAcademy / Session Read")
    Manager = security.Registry.NewGroup("openacademy_manager", "OpenAcademy / Manager", SessionRead)

    h.OpenAcademyCourse().Methods().Load().AllowGroup(SessionRead)
    h.OpenAcademyCourse().Methods().AllowAllToGroup(Manager)
    (...)
}
----

.openacademy/session.go
[source,go]
----
func init() {
(...)
    h.OpenAcademySession().Methods().AllowAllToGroup(Manager)
(...)
}
----

NOTE: Since our `Manager` group inherits from `SessionRead` we don't need to
give permission on the `Load` method again.

To test our access control,

- Click on the `Reload Groups` menu in the `Settings`
- Create a new user "John Smith", and make him a member of `SessionRead`
- Log in as *John Smith* to check the access rights are correct

=== Field Access Control

While Method Execution Control is the main security mechanism used in Doxa,
it is sometimes necessary to limit read or write access for some users to some
fields. This is done through Field Access Control.

[NOTE]
====
The following rules apply:

- If a user without `Read` permission on a field retrieve a record, the value of
the field will be replaced by its Go zero value.
- If a user without `Write` permission on a field writes a record, the value of
the field will not be updated.
====

IMPORTANT: By default, all fields can be accessed for read and write by
`security.GroupEveryone`, a special group to which all users are automatically
added. Therefore, to change a field access, you *must* revoke access to this
group first, or your modifications will have no effect.

Let's make the `TakenSeats` readable only by managers:

.openacademy/session.go
[source,go]
----
func init() {
    (...)
    h.OpenAcademySession().Fields().TakenSeats().RevokeAccess(security.GroupEveryone, security.Read|security.Write)
    h.OpenAcademySession().Fields().TakenSeats().GrantAccess(Manager, security.Read)
    (...)
}
----

=== Record rules

Record Rules allow to grant or deny a group some permissions on a selection of
records. This could be the case for example to allow a salesman only to see his
own sales.

A Record Rule is a struct with the following definition, in the models package:

[source,go]
----
type RecordRule struct {
    Name      string
    Global    bool
    Group     *Group
    Condition *models.Condition
    Perms     Permission
}
----

Let's add a record rule for the model Course and the group
"OpenAcademy / Manager", that restricts `write` and `unlink` accesses
to the responsible of a course. If a course has no responsible, all users
of the group must be able to modify it.

.openacademy/course.go
[source,go]
----
import (
(...)
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/pool/q"
)

func getCurrentUser(rs h.OpenAcademyCourseSet) h.UserSet {
    return h.User().NewSet(rs.Env()).CurrentUser()
}

func init() {
(...)
    cond := q.OpenAcademyCourse().
        Responsible().EqualsFunc(getCurrentUser).
        Or().Responsible().IsNull()

    rule := models.RecordRule {
        Name:      "openacademy_manager_course_write_unlink",
        Group:     Manager,
        Condition: cond.Condition,
        Perms:     security.Write|security.Unlink,
    }
    h.OpenAcademyCourse().AddRecordRule(&rule)
(...)
}
----

== Wizards

Wizards describe interactive sessions with the user (or dialog boxes) through
dynamic forms. A wizard is simply a model that is created with
`DeclareTransientModel` instead of `DeclareModel`. The resulting model has the
following particularities:

- Wizard records are not meant to be persistent; they are automatically deleted
  from the database after a certain time. This is why they are called
  *transient*.
- Wizard models do not require explicit access rights: users have all
  permissions on wizard records.
- Wizard records may refer to regular records or wizard records through many2one
  fields, but regular records *cannot* refer to wizard records through a
  many2one field.

We want to create a wizard that allow users to create attendees for a particular
session, or for a list of sessions at once.

.openacademy/wizard.go
[source,go]
----
package openacademy

import (
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/doxa/models"
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/pool/h"
	"github.com/doxa-erp/doxa/pool/q"
)

func init() {
    h.OpenAcademyWizard().DeclareTransientModel()
    h.OpenAcademyWizard().AddFields(map[string]models.FieldDefinition{
        "Session": models.Many2OneField{RelationModel: h.OpenAcademySession(),
            Required: true},
        "Attendees": models.Many2ManyField{RelationModel: h.Partner()},
    })
}
----

=== Launching wizards

Wizards are launched by window actions, with the attribute `target` set to the
value `new`. The latter opens the wizard view into a popup window. The action
may be triggered by a menu item.

There is another way to launch the wizard: using an `ir.actions.act_window`
record like above, but with an extra field `src_model` that specifies in the
context of which model the action is available. The wizard will appear in the
contextual actions of the model, above the main view.

Wizards use regular views and their buttons may use the attribute
`special="cancel"` to close the wizard window without saving.

Let's:

- Define a form view for the wizard
- Add the action to launch it in the context of the *Session* model
- Define a default value for the session field in the wizard
- Create a method to subscribe users to the session

.openacademy/wizard.go
[source,go]
----
func init() {
(...)
    "Session": models.Many2OneField{RelationModel: h.OpenAcademySession(),
        Required: true, Default:
            func(env models.Environment, fMap models.FieldMap) interface{} {
                activeID := env.Context().GetInteger("active_id")
                return h.OpenAcademySession().Search(env,
                    q.OpenAcademySession().ID().Equals(activeID))
            }
        },

(...)

    h.OpenAcademyWizard().Methods().Subscribe().DeclareMethod(
        `Subscribe subscribes the users to the session`,
        func(rs h.OpenAcademyWizardSet) {
            rs.Session().SetAttendees(rs.Session().Attendees().Union(rs.Attendees()))
        })
(...)
}
----

.openacademy/resources/wizard.xml
[source,xml]
----
<doxa>
    <data>
        <view id="openacademy_wizard_form" model="OpenAcademyWizard">
            <form string="Add Attendees">
                <group>
                    <field name="Session"/>
                    <field name="Attendees"/>
                </group>
                <footer>
                    <button name="Subscribe" type="object"
                            string="Subscribe" class="oe_highlight"/>
                    or
                    <button special="cancel" string="Cancel"/>
                </footer>
            </form>
        </view>

        <action id="openacademy_launch_session_wizard"
                type="ir.actions.act_window"
                name="Add Attendees"
                src_model="OpenAcademySession"
                model="OpenAcademyWizard"
                view_mode="form"
                target="new"/>
    </data>
</doxa>

== Internationalization

=== Translating the application
The application terms can be translated by use of PO files that live in the
`i18n/`subdirectory of our module. Let's see how to create a French
translation:

[source]
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/doxa-erp/doxa-demo
$ mkdir openacademy/i18n
$ doxa i18n update ./openacademy -l fr
----

Now you should have a PO file inside `openacademy/i18n` directory with the
module strings to translate. Go for the translation, and save the file.

Restart the application, but pass the `-l fr` parameter to load the french
translation:

[source]
doxa server -o -l fr

After logging in, go to the preferences menu (top right of the screen) and
set the `lang` field to `fr`. Reload your browser's page and you should see
your translated terms instead of the original ones.
